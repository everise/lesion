    """Compute a brain mask from fMRI data in 3D or 4D ndarrays.

    This is based on an heuristic proposed by T.Nichols:
    find the least dense point of the histogram, between fractions
    lower_cutoff and upper_cutoff of the total image histogram.

    In case of failure, it is usually advisable to increase lower_cutoff.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epi_img: Niimg-like object
        See http://nilearn.github.io/manipulating_images/input_output.html
        EPI image, used to compute the mask. 3D and 4D images are accepted.
        If a 3D image is given, we suggest to use the mean image

    lower_cutoff: float, optional
        lower fraction of the histogram to be discarded.

    upper_cutoff: float, optional
        upper fraction of the histogram to be discarded.

    connected: bool, optional
        if connected is True, only the largest connect component is kept.

    opening: bool or int, optional
        if opening is True, a morphological opening is performed, to keep
        only large structures. This step is useful to remove parts of
        the skull that might have been included.
        If opening is an integer `n`, it is performed via `n` erosions.
        After estimation of the largest connected constituent, 2`n` closing
        operations are performed followed by `n` erosions. This corresponds
        to 1 opening operation of order `n` followed by a closing operator
        of order `n`.
        Note that turning off opening (opening=False) will also prevent
        any smoothing applied to the image during the mask computation.

    ensure_finite: bool
        If ensure_finite is True, the non-finite values (NaNs and infs)
        found in the images will be replaced by zeros

    exclude_zeros: bool, optional
        Consider zeros as missing values for the computation of the
        threshold. This option is useful if the images have been
        resliced with a large padding of zeros.

    target_affine: 3x3 or 4x4 matrix, optional
        This parameter is passed to image.resample_img. Please see the
        related documentation for details.

    target_shape: 3-tuple of integers, optional
        This parameter is passed to image.resample_img. Please see the
        related documentation for details.

    memory: instance of joblib.Memory or string
        Used to cache the function call: if this is a string, it
        specifies the directory where the cache will be stored.

    verbose: int, optional
        Controls the amount of verbosity: higher numbers give
        more messages

    Returns

    mask: nibabel.Nifti1Image
